### Meetups

One of the best ways to meet us is to join us for one of our events. We have
both a lunch and evening meeting each month.

* Lunches are typically on the first Wednesday of the month at 11am at Taqueria
  del Sol (2317 12th Ave S).
* Our evening meetings are in a lecture format. They take place on the fourth
  Thursday of the month at Emma's Bistro (11 Lea Ave) at 6pm.

Occasionally, these times are subject to change so it is always best to check
our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/pynash/) where times and locations are
always posted. RSVPing for either event is encouraged.

PyNash volunteers also co-organize the annual
[PyTennessee](http://www.pytennessee.org) conference, a regional conference that
has attracted nationally-recognized speakers to the area.

### Chat With Us

Our official group chat channel is via IRC. We are located on #pynash on
Freenode. If you're not familiar with Internet Relay Chat you can get started by
using Freenode's [web client](https://webchat.freenode.net/) or signing on with
a service like [IRC Cloud](https://www.irccloud.com). These will allow you to
join the #pynash channel and say hello.

The [Nashville Javascript User Group](https://www.nashjs.org/) has set up a
[Slack group for the Nashville developer
community](http://nashjs.org/blog/post/nashdev-slack) that has gained traction
among non-IRC users. This has the downside of being a proprietary service but
has the benefit of accommodating offline messages, ease of use, and a very
active #python channel.
